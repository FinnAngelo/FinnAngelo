Hi all

No surprise - this is my first post using github, jeckyll and [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub

This isn't the first version of this file, and probably won't be the last. Fortunately it is all in my [github repository] (https://github.com/FinnAngelo/FinnAngelo.github.io) so you can see all my typos etc
